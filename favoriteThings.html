    <h1>My favorite things</h1>
    <p>We all have what we like and what we hate.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Favorite color: Blue and White</strong> </p>
            <p>Blue represents meanings of depth, trust, loyalty, sincerity, wisdom, confidence, stability, faith, and
                intelligence.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Favorite animal: Eagle</strong> </p>
            <p>I like how an eagle can fly however it wants. It has the ultimate freedom. I want to be like an eagle.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>Favorite foods: Sandwich</strong> </p>
            <p>It is both delicious and easy to make. I just fried an egg and two slices of bread with some tomato
                sauce, and it is ready to eat.</p>
