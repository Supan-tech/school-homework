    <h1>When I was young</h1>
    <p>I didn't consider my life lucky when I was a child, as I had several accidents. I once fell from a bridge and
        nearly drowned. <br />The only lucky thing about me is that I passed every class without studying.Â </p>
    <p>When I was young, I liked playing video games. Every time I come back home from school, I play games. I didn't
        pay attention to my studies, and the result was that I was always at the bottom of my class.</p>
    <p>I never cared about anything when I was a child, but now it's different. I have to study hard for my future. Life
        never gets easier; we have to get stronger.</p>
    <p>Whether my life was fortunate or not, I did have a great childhood, as I had enough food, some good friends, and
        many toys to play me.</p>
