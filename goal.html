    <h1>My goal in life</h1>
    <p>I used to be a person who knew nothing about life, without any goal or destination; I let my parents choose
        everything for me. But then I realized this is not how you are supposed to live your life.</p>
    <p>After learning about people like Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Mark Zuckerberg, I know what I want to do. I want to
        do something for the world, like them. They all contribute to the world in some way. Like Mark Zuckerberg's
        Facebook, it helps connect people all around the world. I also want to create something that is useful.</p>
    <p>Even though I don't know what to do, the goal is clear. I want to help the world in some way.</p>
