    <h1>Childhood Dream</h1>
    <p>I dreamed of becoming many things when I was young. Most of the time, I dream of becoming a superhero after
        watching a superhero movie.Â </p>
    <p>Despite having many dreams, two things I want to be the most are an astronaut and a pilot. The reason is that
        most of the jobs require us to work on the ground, but only these two jobs require us to work in the sky and
        space.</p>

    <p>I like how pilots can fly to many places while working, and astronauts can see the world we live in from a
        perspective no one else could.</p>
