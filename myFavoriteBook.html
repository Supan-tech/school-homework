    <h1>My favorite book</h1>
    <p>I don't usually read many books because Google is a better way to learn. But there is one book that I read when I
        was young. It's called 'The Life of Famous People Around the World." That book talks about the lives of many
        famous and successful people.Â </p>
    <p>Before I read the book, I used to think successful people were born successful. Rich people were rich when they
        were born, but I was wrong. The books show how some people struggle in life before they get to where they are,
        they try their best and not giving up.</p>
    <p>What I learn from that book is that you have to fight for what you want; nothing comes easy.</p>
