    <h1>My Personality</h1>
    <p>People today frequently ignore personality and simply value attractiveness. I think beauty is important, but
        personality is more important.</p>
    <p>I am not perfect, but I always try to be the best version of myself. I'm a very friendly person, but I become
        very aggressive when I get serious. I become very talkative around close friends. I don't have a lot of friends,
        as I am not a very social person.</p>
    <p>If I were to rate myself, I would give myself a 5/10.</p>
