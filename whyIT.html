    <p>I did have multiple dream jobs when I was young, but as we all know, a child's dream job is nothing more than a
        dream.</p>
    <p>One of the reasons I choose IT is that when I was in 11th grade, I learned about coding for the first time by
        watching YouTube. I did follow some online tutorials, and I can say I like them. Coding was like magic to me at
        that time.</p>
    <p>Another reason is that I don't know any other majors.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, I like working with computers, which is why I chose to study computer science.</p>
